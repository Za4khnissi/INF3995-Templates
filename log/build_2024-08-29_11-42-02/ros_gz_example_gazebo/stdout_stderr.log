[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findignition-common4.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ignition-common4", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ignition-common4"
  with any of the following names:

    ignition-common4Config.cmake
    ignition-common4-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ignition-common4" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ignition-common4_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "ignition-common4" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
